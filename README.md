# Instrument_cluster
This project involves the implementation of an instrument cluster as the second DES (Distributed Embedded Systems) project in the SEA:ME curriculum.

## Overview
An instrument cluster, also known as a dashboard cluster or gauge cluster, is a critical component of a vehicle’s dashboard. It provides the driver with essential information about the vehicle’s status and performance through various gauges, indicators, and warning lights. Here, we implement an instrument cluster showing real-time speed data on a screen with GUI.
